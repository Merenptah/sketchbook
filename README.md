# Sketchbook

This repository is supposed to act as a sketchbook, resembling what artists use to check out different techniques, tools, colors, genres. So there is no perfection intended, just playing around with different languages, approaches and so on, to have a place to experiment and improve.

As such, it will not be sorted by topic, language or technique, but chronologically, as it would be as an artist's sketchbook.

## To be tried out
- Using result objects
    - in general
    - during creation of a parameter object
    - in a controller
- More gneric result object to handle response of external service
- ATDD: using rules in Cucumber
- Kotlin DSL
- Rust Refactoring
