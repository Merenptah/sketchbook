This is an experiment with "custom methods" as defined by "API Design Patterns" by J. J. Geewax.

Does the syntax "/rockets/{id}:launch" work
- with Spring? Yes, it does, no problem at all.
- and with Open API? Yes, it does.

Interestingly, different AI models claim that both would not work, because the ":" was illegal. Which, of course, it is not.
