# Result objects using inheritance
Define the result functionality using inheritance instead of putting it all within the `Result` 
class.

Honestly, this is much cleaner, while the usage is exactly the same as putting it all into one 
class. No more `if`-clauses necessary. Absolutely clean inheritance.

Concentrating on minimal functionality, bindings etc. not tried out.
